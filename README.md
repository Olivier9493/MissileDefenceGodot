# MissileDefenceGodot
First Game with GodotEngine based on the awesome course from **gamedev.tv** [Discovering Godot C# - Make your first Godot C# Game](https://www.gamedev.tv/p/discovering-godot-c-make-your-first-godot-c-video-game?coupon=1D3ABAD8)
I try to improve the result you get at the end of this course by adding some few addtional features.
## Features Added
- Add sounds
  - For the missile launch
  - For the explosion
- Add an extra life to the health as soon that 5 ennemies are destroyed
  - Text Animation to notice the addtional point
- High score feature
  - save the high score in a file as dictionary
  - load the file at the beginning of the game
  - add the possibility to the player to save the data with his name in the file if his score is the highest
  
## Next steps
Of course, we are still very far from a finished game and many improvements are still posssible. It was my first try with Godot Engine and C#. I hadn't any experience in both area.
It was a lot of fun.
